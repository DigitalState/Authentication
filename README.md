# Authentication

The DigitalState Authentication microservice provides centralized authentication capabilities for users.

It uses the [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/) open standard, which enables a way to securely transfer user identity and claims information within the DigitalState microservices architecture.

It also provides a variety of features such as user management, self-registration, oauth login and password recovery.
